# SUSS-Applied-Project-2022
Over the last 10 years, Lush Singapore has been building itself as a high quality and well-reputable brand that we know of today. However, the company still faces major business challenges that has been affecting its business performance. This presents an opportunity to explore and understand the key issues affecting Lush Singapore through the use of automation and machine learning. A sentiment analysis model was created to classify customer product reviews into positive or negative sentiment polarity. Three supervised machine learning algorithms were compared against each other in respect to their performance. RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm was applied to customer product reviews to determine its effectiveness for a small-scale thematic analysis, which aims to uncover positive and negative factors affecting Lush Singaporeâ€™s business performance.
