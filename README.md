# SUSS-Applied-Project-2022
A sentiment analysis model was created to classify customer product reviews into positive or negative sentiment polarity. Three supervised machine learning algorithms were compared against each other in respect to their performance: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbour. RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm was applied to customer product reviews to determine its effectiveness for a small-scale thematic analysis, which aims to uncover positive and negative factors affecting business performance. Full details can be found in SUSS_2022_Applied Project Final Report.
